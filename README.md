# Jumper
Experience the classic fun of Hangman in our new game, Jumper! <i>Jumper</i> may appear to be fun and easy, but if you're not careful you may quickly lose your parachute. The game is simple. The Jumper has a parachute and needs to land safely, however, in order to do so you must guess the secret word correctly. With each correct guess, a lettle of the secret word will appear, but with each wrong guess, the Jumper will lose a piece of his parachute. Guessing continues until either the secret word is figured out, or until the Jumper's parachute is gone.
